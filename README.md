# Brickhill friend bot
- Goes thru user ids incrementally!
- If it reaches account that hasnt been created yet it will wait until it is created and friends it.
- Writes down already friended accounts so it can friend easily later (Supports using different accounts on the script)

## How to setup?
1. [Download chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), make sure you choose the right version, you can find your chrome version from chrome://version/
2. Open and make sure chromedriver is running on port 9515 (Default port)
3. Open the bot program

## Anything else?
- Usernames are case sensitive, so make sure you have same capitalization each time you login to your account
- If you are moving the program make sure to take the users.txt file along with it!
