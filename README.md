# Brickhill friend bot
- Goes thru user ids incrementally!
- If it reaches account that hasnt been created yet it will wait until it is created and friends it.
- Writes down already friended accounts so it can friend easily later (Supports using different accounts on the script)

## How to setup?
1. [Download chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads),make sure you choose the right version, you can find your chrome version from chrome://version/
2. Make sure chromedriver is running on port 9515 (Default port usually)

## Anything else?
Usernames with spaces in them seem bugged, suggest you not use them. 
Usernames are case sensitive, so make sure you have same capitalization each time you login to your account!
Program currently crashes when it doesnt find friend request button, so it crashes when you have already sent friend request or if you are already friends with somebody!
