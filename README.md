# Brickhill friend bot
- Goes thru user ids incrementally!
- If it reaches account that hasnt been created yet it will wait until it is created and friends it.
- Writes down already friended accounts so it can friend easily later (Supports using different accounts on the script)

## How to setup?
Download chromedriver and set it to port 4444
`chromedriver --port=4444`
